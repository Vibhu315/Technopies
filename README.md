Plant diseases monitoring using machine learning involves using computer vision techniques to analyze images of plants and identify any signs of disease or damage and redirect the user to the respected solutions on e-commerece website. The system can help farmers and agricultural experts detect and diagnose plant diseases early, which can prevent the spread of the disease and reduce crop lossesd.
The model is trained using ML and frontend is developed in HTML/CSS and redirection to e-commerce website is done using Python(Can also be done using web scrapping, but that will be a chaotic process).
